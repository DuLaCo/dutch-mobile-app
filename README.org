#+title: dutch-mobile-app (name WIP)


React Native App for training Dutch vowel sounds (and possibly more)

* What is it

According to research^{TM} adults are pretty good at learning new words, but pretty shite at learning new vowel sounds. One way to train the latter is by actively
practicing to distinguish the sounds in words. That is what this app tries to do, plus some more.

This is my first React Native project so it will be somewhat messy, but hopefully it will be functional at the end.

Check out an earlier [[https://github.com/ThomasJorna/dutch-language-course][web-version here]].

* Where to download

The app is not in a useable state yet, but will be released on Android and hopefully on iOS when finished.
